# Prompt Engineering Process

### Step 1
#### Intention
>Trying to get the deepseek model to run

#### Action/Change
>Give a basic response

#### Result
>What was the result?

#### Reflection/Analysis of the result. 
>It worked as expected

### Step 2
#### Intention
>Make it more creative.
#### Action/Change
>Raise the tempurature to 0.5.

#### Result
>It started to repeat the same output.

#### Reflection/Analysis of the result. 
>I need to lower the tempurature a little

### Step 3
#### Intention
>Make it less creative.
#### Action/Change
>Lower the tempurature to 0.3.

#### Result
>It give a better, less repeated output

#### Reflection/Analysis of the result. 
>I like this tempuraure more

### Step 4
#### Intention
>Give it more context to its fundumental role.
#### Action/Change
>I had GPT generate a larger context message to preload the model with

#### Result
>It seems to have a much better understanding of what we want the model to do

#### Reflection/Analysis of the result. 
>This is definately in the right direction. Could tweak in the future once we know more of how it should work overall.

### Step 5
#### Intention
>Try another model 7b.
#### Action/Change
>I loaded the deepseek-r1:7b model

#### Result
>Hard to tell how much it actually improved.

#### Reflection/Analysis of the result. 
>The model takes longer and will need more in-depth prompts to tell if this is an improvment.
